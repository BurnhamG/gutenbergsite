Contact Information
===================

## Electronic Mail
The best way to get in touch is by email. 

Please note:

- You cannot click on the address, but must copy it to your email program manually and adjust it to be a valid email address. We apologize for the inconvenience but this helps hiding our addresses from spammers.
- Include a descriptive subject line, or your email will end up in our spam jail.
- Don't send email as HTML only, or only within attachments.
- Be patient. We get a lot of email. If you don't get a response within the time mentioned below, please resend your email.

Please select the most appropriate address from this list. 

1. help2020 (at) pglaf.org

    General help. Requests for information about Project Gutenberg eBooks or the Project Gutenberg Web pages. Responses typically within two days. 

2. errata2020 (at) pglaf.org

    Errata within eBooks. To report an error within an eBook (such as a missing word), please be sure to include the eBook number or specific filename or download link you used. Error reports are easiest to handle when they clearly indicate the context in which an error was found. Note that since Project Gutenberg includes many old titles, it is common for unusual spelling or arcane word uses to be used. If possible, check a printed source to verify whether an error exists, before reporting it. Messages to the errata list generate an automatic response that your report was received. 

    Any errata/bug/typo report is welcome! There is additional guidance in the FAQ on how to prepare errata reports so they are easiest for the Project Gutenberg team to handle. Start with [this guidance](/help/errata.html) on how to report typos.

3. catalog2020 (at) pglaf.org

    Catalog metadata errors. Report an error in the online catalog (such as a misspelled author name). There is no automated response, but typically your message is handled within a few days.

4. copyright2020 (at) pglaf.org

    Copyright inquiries. Project Gutenberg copyright inquiries. But see [cand.pglaf.org](http://cand.pglaf.org) before reporting potential misuse of copyrighted materials. For licensing questions, permissions and other such inquiries, the answer is probably in our [Permission How-To](). Please don't send email without first checking the How-To. Responses are typically sent within two days.

5. gbnewby (at) pglaf.org

    Contact the CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Dr. Gregory Newby. If you don't get a response within a few days, please first check your spam filters & similar for a response. Resend your message, if no response is received within a few days.
