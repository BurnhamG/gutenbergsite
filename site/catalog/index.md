Offline Book Catalog: Browse and Search eBooks
==============================================

Note: we also have [offline book catalogs](/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html) to download and use offline.

## Browse by Author, Title, Language or Recently Posted

Our browse pages are ideal to view what's in the collection 
if you are yet undecided on what you want to read

### Recently posted
The recently posted pages list what new books got added or
updated most recently. There is also an [RSS feed](/feeds/today.rss)
(you'll need a feed reader software to utilize this.)

*Freshness:* updated nightly.

### Top 100 Books<

If you are yet undecided, maybe you can find something on our [top 100
list](/browse/scores/top).

### Book Catalog Search 

If you already know what book you want to read, you may [search our
catalog](/ebooks/) for author, title, or subjects.  Subject headings
are what are known as controlled-vocabulary terms, from the
U.S. Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).  Subject searching
is, therefore, not the same as full text searching.

*Freshness:* Search is always up to date with titles and
authors. Subjects may be updated later.

## External Search Engines

Project Gutenberg does not operate these search engines. We provide 
links in the hopes they may be useful.

### Yahoo

Project Gutenberg is a participant in Yahoo!'s Content Acquisition
Program.  This provides a search of book metadata (author, title,
brief description, keywords).

*Freshness:* updated approximately weekly.

<form method="get" action="http://search.yahoo.com/search">
<table class="tablet">
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">
      <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/"><img src="/pics/yahoologo.png" style="border-style: none;" alt="Yahoo! logo"></a>
      <input type="hidden" name="fr" value="cap-PG">
      <input type="hidden" name="vs" id="ysvs1" value="gutenberg.org">
    </td>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <input type="submit" value="Yahoo! Search">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</form>

### Google

Google's has full-text, or "nearly" full-text search (at least the
first 100K or so of .html, .txt, and possibly other formats).

*Freshness:* updated approximately monthly.

<form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search">
  <table class="tablet">
    <tr>
      <td>
        Google Full Text:
      </td>
      <td>
        <input type="text" name="q" size="31" maxlength="255" value="">
      </td>
      <td>
        eg.: Sherlock Holmes
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <input type="hidden" name="domains" value="gutenberg.org"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" value="gutenberg.org"/>
