# Readers' FAQ

Most of this page is no longer actively maintained. Some content may be inaccurate or outdated - especially external links. The advice tends to focus on solo producers of eBooks, emphasizing plain text.

# About Finding eBooks
## How can I find an eBook I'm looking for?
For PG books, the simplest way is to go to the [Online Search page](https://dev.gutenberg.org/ebooks/), type the Author or Title into the search form, press the "Search" button, and follow the choices. There also is a full-text search available.

## Can I get a complete list of Project Gutenberg eBooks?
Yes. [GUTINDEX.ALL](https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL) is the raw list of files posted.  

## How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog?
We have to divide this question into two answers, for books up to 10,000, and books after 10,000, or reposted since we moved past 10,000.

Books posted after 10,000 go into a new, simpler, naming scheme. Books REposted after we passed 10,000 (around November 2003) also use this scheme. We are reposting many older books, with improvements and corrections, all the time, and older books may also be reposted into the new scheme.

You can see clearly from the line in GUTINDEX.ALL whether the book is in the old naming scheme or the new naming scheme. Where the line starts with a Month and Year, and contains a file-name template in square brackets, the book is still in the old scheme, for example: 
<pre>
Feb 2005 Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse     [mikewxxx.xxx] 7423
</pre>

The line for the same book, in the new naming scheme, would omit the Month and Year, and the filename base, and look like: 
<pre>
Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse                             7423
</pre>

### Books after 10,000 — the new naming scheme
To find a text with a number over 10,000, or one that has been reposted since we passed 10,000, you must know the eBook number. You can get this from [GUTINDEX.ALL](https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL) 

Once you know the number, you can find the directory containing all formats of it. Formally, the directory for the eBook will be contained in a hierarchy of directories, each one a single digit, being all the digits of the etext number except the last, in order. The name of the directory for the eBook itself will be the number of the eBook. But it's easier to see by example. 

The files for eBook number 10214 will be found in the directory 1/0/2/1/10214 on the download site you choose. So, for example, if you are downloading eBook 10214 from our main site by HTTP from [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/), you can just go to [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/1/10214/](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/1/10214/) and download whichever of the formats you want. 

Or, instead of typing in the whole address, for numbers beginning with the digit "1", you can just go to [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/) and navigate down the list of directories. 

### Books before 10,000 — the old naming scheme
In short, just browse to: 
[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/)
choose the schedule year of the text (newly-posted texts will usually be in the latest year) and look down the list to find the filename you're looking for. 

In general, you need to know: 
1. the address of an FTP site
2. the schedule year of the text you want
3. the basename of the text you want.
The fastest and safest FTP site to use for this is [ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org](ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org),  which is the first of our two primary posting sites (the other being [ftp://ftp.archive.org](ftp://ftp.archive.org) ). We post to these two sites, and then other sites copy from them at intervals, so with any FTP sites other than these two, the file may not be available immediately. 

You can get the schedule year and basename of the text from its line in GUTINDEX.ALL. Let's take an example. The file 
<pre>
Mar 2004 The Herd Boy and His Hermit, by C. M. Yonge [#32][hrdbhxxx.xxx]5313
</pre>

has been posted just a few hours ago as I write this. From the GUTINDEX entry, the schedule year is 2004, and the basename of the text is hrdbh. 

We divide our texts into directories (folders) based on the schedule year, so this eBook will be in the directory for 2004, which will be named something ending in /etext04. All the directories are named etext plus the last two digits of the year. (Somebody's going to have to change that convention in about 87 years from now! :-) We currently have directories starting at 90, running through the 90s and then 00, 01, 02, 03, 04. All eBooks produced before 1991 are in the /etext90 directory, so if you're looking for 
<pre>
Dec 1971 Declaration of Independence                      [whenxxxx.xxx]  1
</pre>

or 

<pre>
Aug 1989 The Bible, Both Testaments, King James Version   [kjv10xxx.xxx] 10
</pre>

you should look in /etext90. 

As it happens, ibiblio supports both HTTP (web) and FTP access to the text, so we can just browse to [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/) and choose the 2004 directory from there. 

If you want to automate this, you could also use the more direct address [ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/](ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/)

The equivalent address for ftp.archive.org is [ftp://ftp.archive.org/pub/etext/etext04/](ftp://ftp.archive.org/pub/etext/etext04/)

Either way, we see a long page of files, in alphabetical order. Scroll down to the "H"s and look for hrdbh. We see four files with this basename: 
<pre>
hrdbh10.txt
hrdbh10.zip
hrdbh10h.htm
hrdbh10h.zip
</pre>

## You don't have the eBook I'm looking for. Can you help me find it?
Sorry, no. We can suggest (see below) some other places to look for publicly accessible books on the Net, but we can't do the search for you. 

## Where else can I go to get eBooks?
The [Online Books Page](https://onlinebooks.library.upeen.edu/) specializes in creating a list of all books on-line from any source. Searching there is a good place to start. 

If you're looking for commercial books, like current textbooks or bestsellers, you're not likely to find them here, since recent books are not in the public domain. For these, you should look for commercial booksellers on the Net — any search engine will direct you to some if you enter search terms like "shop ebook". 

## I see some eBooks in several places on the Net. Do different people really re-create the same eBooks?
It does happen, but mostly by accident. Anyone experienced in eBook creation will first search the usual places to see whether anyone else has already transcribed the book they're interested in. If it has been transcribed, they will not duplicate the effort.

Etexts that are in the public domain very often float around the Net for years — stored in a gopher server here, posted to Usenet there, held on someone's local computer for a year or two and then reformatted as HTML and uploaded to a web site somewhere else. And this is good, because we want texts to be copied as widely as possible. 

Public domain eBooks are fair game for anyone to copy, correct, mark up, package and post: that's what being in the public domain means.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often quickly copied and reformatted, and posted on other sites like Blackmask Online and Steve Sakoman's site at [http://www.sakoman.net/](http://www.sakoman.net/). Unfortunately the Blackmask Online website is down due to a lawsuit about the copyright of the Doc Savage books. 

If you find an eBook in many different places, the odds are good that it came from one original source, and was copied around.

It does sometimes happen that people duplicate the transcription of books already made into text. Sometimes it's because they didn't find the version already made. Sometimes they have a different edition, and want to transcribe that. Mostly, though, we all try not to do more work than we have to. 

## About Using the Web Site
### Why couldn't I reach your site? (or: Why is your site slow?)
There may be a bottleneck somewhere else between you and the site. If at first you don't succeed, don't tell us, just try, try again. The correct address is: 
http://www.gutenberg.org/

### I get an error when I try to download a book.
Many FTP sites throughout the world hold the whole Project Gutenberg archive of texts. An FTP site is just a computer on the Internet that specializes in holding files for download and sending them to people on request. You can find a list of FTP sites that hold Gutenberg texts at [http://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL](http://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL).

When you're searching or browsing for titles and authors, you're on this Project Gutenberg site, but if you choose one of the mirrors, or another method of downloading, when you click on the book to download it, you are connected to an FTP (or HTTP) site. At the time you click on the filename, your browser contacts an FTP site and tries to download the file from there. If you get an error, it could be because the FTP site is busy, or because there's a network traffic bottleneck between you and that FTP site, or because the text you're looking for is missing from that FTP site.

Usually, the easiest solution is to choose another FTP site to download your text from. Go to the Search page, choose a different FTP site, and search again for your text. 

Tip: You should always try to choose the FTP site closest to you. Not only are you helping to minimize Net traffic by choosing a nearby site, but your file will download faster!

If all else fails, note the year and the filename of the book you want, if it's below number 10,000, or its number, if above 10,000, choose an FTP site from this list and click on one of them. Then browse your way through the listings to the file you want.

For example, if you find Lady Susan by Jane Austen, you will see that it was published by Gutenberg in 1997, and its filename is lsusn10.txt, so browse to one of the FTP sites, choose the directory called /etext97 and click (or right-click and Save, depending on your browser) on the file lsusn10.txt. Or, in the case of Clarissa, Volume 6 by Richardson, which is #11364, you will find it in the directory /1/1/3/6/11364 

### I searched for a book I know is in Project Gutenberg, but got no results.
First go to the Advanced Search page. Sometimes you may miss in searching because of alternative spellings, so try searching separately using just one word in Author or Title. Read the Search Tips.

If that fails, you can Browse through the site catalog. Let's say you're looking for **The Wandering Jew** by Eugene Sue. 

Go to the [Online Catalog](https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/) page.
Once on this page, click on: "S" in "Authors:" 
You should now see a list of all of the Authors whose last name starts with "S". Scroll down till you find the direct links to the Sue, Eugene works.

Click on the work you are interested to, then click on the file link found on the page you were brought to, Etext 3350 when selecting the work, as immediately above.

On this page, above the excerpt, there are download links: 
Click on the link of your choice - plain text or zipped, and from ibiblio.org or other.

If you choose one of the mirrors, you are then brought to a new page, asking you to select an "Download site". Further details on how and why to choose an "FTP Site" are available on this page.

Select a site, and the file will be downloaded, or offered for download, depending on which format you selected and which browser you use. 

If you can't find your text either way, the book has not been cataloged. If you know that the book has been posted recently, and maybe hasn't made it into the catalog yet, read: [ How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog?]( How can I download a PG text without using the web catalog?) 

If even this doesn't help, don't despair! We don't have it, but it may be elsewhere on the Web. Go to the major search engines and try there. You can also try looking in the Book Search section of [The Online Books Page](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu), and if you have no luck with that, you might be able to find it listed as being In Progress somewhere on their [Books In Progress and Requested](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/in-progress.html) page.

### Can I copy your website, or your website materials?
No.

Keeping the PG site updated with the latest e-text releases is an ongoing job, and our experience is that people, however well-intentioned, do not keep copies up to date. We want there to be one clear source for people seeking the latest Project Gutenberg information, and we think that having a lot of out-of-date copies and partial copies scattered around the net would be a Bad Thing. 

We welcome mirrors and copies of our e-texts, in new FTP sites (see: Can I become an FTP mirror?), but the main web site itself is copyrighted and may not be copied. 

### Your site doesn't look right in my browser. I clicked on a button, and nothing happened.
We take a lot of trouble to ensure that our website uses only valid, standard HTML, and we're not even slightly tempted to use glitzy features that look good in one browser but don't work in another, so we can promise you that our site is not the problem.

If you actually clicked on a button, like the Search button, and nothing happened, you might be behind a proxy or web filter that doesn't like you making POST requests. If you have a web filter switched on, turn it off, reload the page and try again.

### What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean?
Our texts are not actually held on the website. The website just holds an index; the files themselves are held on many sites throughout the world, called FTP sites. When you have found the book you're looking for, and you make that final click to get it, you're not actually talking to our website any more — you are transferred to the FTP site you selected. Some FTP sites are near you; some are far away. Some may be faster than others, even if they are about the same distance; some may have temporary technical problems.

You should usually select the FTP site nearest you. If you find you're having problems with that one, you can select another. 

### What exactly is an FTP site anyway? 
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, one of the oldest and most reliable protocols of the internet. This is the method by which a file can be copied from one computer to another. 

We now have some HTTP (web) sites containing eBooks as well, including our main site at http://www.gutenberg.org/. You can use either HTTP or FTP. 

An FTP site, or FTP server, is a computer that holds files that people can upload and download. In the case of PG, the Posting Team upload our texts when they're ready to two main FTP servers, ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org and ftp://ftp.archive.org ,  which serve as our master copies. 

Other FTP sites around the world automatically download the files from these master sites, so they have a full set of PG publications for you to download. Because they only check for updates and new files at intervals, some FTP sites may be a day or two behind. Some FTP sites don't have space available for everything, so they may hold only the zipped versions of the files. But most FTP sites will have the entire PG collection. These are called FTP "mirrors", since they are a copy of the original.

Many FTP sites exist that offer a full PG mirror but are not on our FTP sites list. Commonly, these are in schools, where they serve the local students, but don't have enough bandwidth to offer downloads to worldwide users. 

### Can I become an FTP mirror?
Yes! We're always looking for more FTP mirrors.

If you manage an FTP site with 100 GB or so of free space, please check our [Contact Information page](/about/contact_information.html) and contact the appropriate person, who will make the arrangements for you. 

### Can I make a private FTP mirror for my school, library or organization?
Yes.

We like all FTP mirrors to be open to as many people as possible, but we know that not all schools have the resources to be a public mirror, so we welcome all mirrors.

And anyway, you don't even have to ask, because we don't control what happens to our texts once we post them! 

### When I clicked on the file I want, nothing happened.
When you select a file for download, your request goes to the FTP site you selected, not to our website. If the FTP site you selected is having problems, or if there is the Net version of a traffic jam between you and it, you may have problems downloading. 

Select a different FTP site (see: [What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean?](What does that thing about "mirror sites" mean?) and try again. 

###  How many texts are downloaded through the web site?
Go to the [Top 100 Page]().

### What are the most popular books?
Go to the [Top 100 Page]().  


These numbers vary a lot. When a movie based on a classic is released, downloads of that eBook go through the roof! 

## About Downloading and Using Project Gutenberg eBooks
### Should I download a ZIP or a TXT file?
If you know how to unzip a file, then downloading the zip is faster. For some non-text eBooks that contain multiple files, like HTML with included images, only a zip file may be available. For some other formats, like MP3 or MPEG, there may not be a zipped version available because the native format of the file is already compressed enough that zipping it doesn't save much. 

###  I've got a ZIP file. What do I do with it?
Unzip it.

If you want a free program, you could try the open source Info-Zip software available at [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/) for Mac, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows and just about everything else you might have. 

If you want a commercial program, PKZIP from  [http://www.pkware.com](http://www.pkware.com) and WinZip from [http://www.winzip.com](http://www.winzip.com) are among many popular shareware utilities that allow you to unzip files. 

Mac-users using Stuffit Expander may like to set a preference (File / Preferences / Cross Platform) to "Convert text files to Macintosh format … When a file is known to contain text". This gets rid of strange characters (linefeeds), which are not wanted on a Mac, at the beginnings of lines. MacZip is another free program for Macs. Mac users can also try ZipIt or other shareware programs available from the Info-Mac archives, e.g. from [ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Compress_&_Translate/](ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Compress_&_Translate/). 

### I tried to unzip my file, but it said the file was corrupt, or damaged.
The chances are that it didn't download correctly. Try downloading it again. If you don't succeed the second time, try downloading the unzipped version. 

### I see gibberish onscreen when I click on a book.
To save download time, our etexts are stored in zipped form as well as text form. Zipped files are smaller, and take less time to transfer to your computer, but you need a program to unzip them. If you try to view a zipped file directly, it looks like gibberish.

You can recognize zipped files easily because their filenames end in .zip. 

If this happens, either make sure you're asking your browser to Save the file rather than display it (often, you right-click the file and choose Save) or else click on the version of the file that ends in .txt instead of .zip. You don't need a zip program to view .txt files.

Looking at a zip rather than a text file is by far the most common reason for this problem, but there are some others. If you're quite sure that you're not looking at a zip file, then it could be that the file you downloaded is in a character set that your viewer doesn't recognize, like Big-5 [V.78] for Chinese texts, or Unicode [V.77]. If this is the case, you will have to find a viewer that works on your computer for the specified character set. We may also have an ASCII version of the same text available for you — we do try to have ASCII versions for everything [G.17], but some languages, like Chinese, just cannot be sensibly expressed in ASCII.

If you can see most of the characters, enough to be able to make out the text, but there are regular gibberish characters, black squares, empty boxes or obviously missing characters scattered about through words, then you are probably looking at an "8-bit" text [V.79], with accented characters, and your viewer doesn't handle the character set. See the FAQ "I can read the text file, but a few characters appear as black squares, or gibberish" [R.31].

If there are a very few gibberish characters, black squares or obviously missing characters in the text, then it's likely that this was intended to be a 7-bit text, but a few 8-bit characters like the British pound symbol or accented letters slipped through. 

### Can I download and read your books?
Yes. That's what Project Gutenberg is all about — making texts available free to everyone!

### What am I allowed to do with the books I download?
Most Project Gutenberg e-texts are in the public domain. You can do anything you like with these — you can re-post them on your site, print them, distribute them, translate them to other languages, convert them to other formats, or redistribute them in unchanged form. However, if you distribute versions under the Project Gutenberg trademark, we do impose some conditions, which are explained in the header and/or footer in each text.

Some Project Gutenberg e-texts have copyright restrictions. You can still download and read these, but you may not be allowed to reproduce, modify or distribute them. When browsing or searching on the site, you will see these copyright-restricted texts indicated in the listings. For fuller information about them, download the e-text and read the header or footer of the file, which will spell out the conditions in detail.

### Does Project Gutenberg know who downloads their books?
No, and we don't want to!

Like any Internet transfer, our sites have to know the IP addresses that contact them; without that, no communication is possible. But we do not trace, hold or examine them beyond what is necessary to deal with any problems or maintain logs or statistics. We never identify IP addresses with people.

Further, we encourage people, sites, schools around the world to mirror, or copy, our texts to their sites. Once that happens, we have no control over them, and we never have any idea who or even how many people access them after that.

Even further, we encourage people to distribute the texts on disks, CDs, paper, and any other storage format they can find. We encourage them to convert the texts to other formats, and share them.

For most people reading this, anonymity is probably not an issue, but you may live in a place or time where reading Paine, or Voltaire, or the Bible, or the Koran, is considered suspicious or even subversive. We don't know who you are, and what we don't know, we can't tell.

Currently (2004), by means of DRM (Digital Rights/Restrictions Management) many commercial publishers can make a list of exactly who is reading which of their eBooks. We don't know, and we don't want to know. 

### I've found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. How should I report them?

(This section was updated in October 2019)

Errata reports, typos, etc. are welcome and appreciated. Please visit the contact information page for the current correct email address to send reports to.

It is necessary to report the full title, author, and etext number of the text you are correcting. We have multiple editions of some texts, like Homer's "Odyssey", and unless you tell us exactly what eBook you mean we have to spend much time searching and guessing which file you were reading. It is important to specify that you are reporting errors found in the text, html, .mobi or .epub file.

It is usually easiest to cut and paste the line where the error is into your e-mail, with your comment.

A report for a typical errata list might look like: 
<pre>
The Odyssey, by Homer
         April, 1999  [Etext #1728]

      Line 884:
        back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month.
          "bas" should be "has"

      Line 1491:
        Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning
           "would" and "ask" are run together here

      Line 1563:
        in his father's seat and the elders gave place to him
           This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end.

      Line 15346-7:
         'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the
         will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have
            I think there is something missing between "the" and "will"
</pre>
But the following gets the job done: 
<pre>
      In Homer's Odyssey, Etext #1728,
      I found the following errors:

      Telemachus, who bas now resided
      change "bas" to "has"

      But I wouldask thee,
      "would ask" run together

      and the elders gave place to him
      needs period

      ye men of Ithaca, to the
      will say.
      line missing between "the" and "will"?
</pre>
Or, even shorter and easiest to use: 
<pre>
      In Homer's "Odyssey", Etext #1728, I found the
      following errors:

      Telemachus, who bas now resided
      bas ==> has

      But I wouldask thee,
      wouldask ==> would ask

      and the elders gave place to him
      him ==> him.

      ye men of Ithaca, to the
      will say.
      line or words missing between "the" and "will"?
</pre>
The common error of copying several lines or the entire paragraph which contains the error followed by the same paragraph with the error corrected makes it very difficult and time consuming for the editor to locate the error. Please use one of the errata report formats above.

On the other hand it is also important to give a long enough portion of the line with the error as there may be dozens of instances of a short phrase.

For example: 
<pre>
      to him
      him ==> him.
</pre>


may take 10 minutes or more of the editor's time searching for "to him" if there are 100 instances of "to him" in the eBook.

Experienced Project Gutenberg contributors may find that when there are a great many suspected errors it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected version of the text and html files.

If you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like "Gutcheck" or "Jeebies" to find errors, you might mention something like: "Gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes".

When you are able to find the eBook's title in an online eBook such as "The Internet Archive", it is a great help to us if you verify your suggested changes and in your report let us know you have done so and the source used.

Any errata submissions are freely made, without obligation, and are entirely in the public domain. 

### I've found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. Who should I report them to?
The Posting Team, who post the books, also make the corrections, and ultimately, the corrections need to go to them. Visit [the Contact Us](/about/contact_information.html) page for the current email address of the errata team (it is changed periodically to cut down on spam).

Many producers put their e-mail addresses in their texts, specifically so that readers can contact them when errors are found. If you see that in your text, you should try to contact the producer first. This is especially true if the corrections aren't obvious, as in the case of missing words. The producer is likely to have the original book, and will probably be able to confirm your corrections without visiting a library. If the book needs the corrections, the producer can then notify the Posting Team.

If you get no response from the producer, or if there is no e-mail address listed, or if the corrections are small and obvious, you should send them to the email address for reporting errors listed on the Contacts Page where members of the posting team will deal with them.
