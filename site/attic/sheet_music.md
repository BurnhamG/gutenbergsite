Sheet Music How-To (old)
========================

This page is partially or entirely outdated: Please see current guidance in the [help section](/help/). Project Gutenberg is no longer accepting new sheet music submissions.

The Project Gutenberg Sheet Music Project was devoted to digitizing musical scores for a variety of uses. Most scores so far have been chamber music by composers such as Mozart and Beethoven. This document is to give a brief overview of what is needed to digitize a new score for the Project Gutenberg collection. 

As for any Project Gutenberg submission, the first step is to secure a [copyright clearance](/help/copyright.html) US copyright laws make inclusion of items post-1922 problematic. Generally, the best bet is to use a printed score from pre-1923. 

The choice of what software to use for digitization is up to you. There are three main contenders: Finale, Sibelius, and Lilypond. The first two are commercial software products with many features. The last is an open source project (really, a markup format) associated with several different tools. Our experience is that any can be used to create top-quality digital scores, and that each has its limitations. We have also heard about [Muscript](https://pjb.com.au/muscript/) which offers plain ASCII markup for creating scores. 

The output formats are up to you, but we encourage all possible output formats for your digitization method. These may include:

- Lilypond files
- PDF files with the "printed" score
- MusicML
- MIDI
- Finale's .MUS format
- Sibelius's .SIB format

There are other software choices, and other formats. When possible, consider making the separate parts available as separate files (i.e., so Violin 1 could have her own score, and Viola could have his own score).
