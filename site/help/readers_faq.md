# About Finding eBooks
## How can I find an eBook I'm looking for?
For Project Gutenberg (PG) eBooks, the simplest way is to go to the [Online Search page](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/), type the Author or Title into the search form, press the "Search" button, and follow the choices. You can specify fields to search, such as "a.Twain" for authors named "Twain." There also is a full-text search available.

## Can I get a complete list of Project Gutenberg eBooks?
Yes. Visit the "offline catalogs" page. The [GUTINDEX.ALL](https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL) file is the raw list of all books posted, and is updated approximately monthly.

## You don't have the eBook I'm looking for. Can you help me find it?
Sorry, no. Please check with your local librarian.

## Where else can I go to find eBooks?
The [Online Books Page](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/) specializes in creating a list of free books on-line from any source. Searching there is a good place to start. 

If you're looking for commercial books, like current textbooks or bestsellers, you're not likely to find them here, since recent books are not in the public domain. For these, you should look for commercial booksellers on the Net — any search engine will direct you to some if you enter search terms like "shop ebook". 

### Can I copy your website, or your website materials?
See the Permissions page. Basically, the content (eBooks) are available for unlimited free redistribution. There are limitations on commercial (for-fee) redistribution, derivative works, and our copyrighted works.

The website is not currently set up for copying, and automated anti-abuse tools might prevent mass downloads. The offline catalogs,
mentioned above, include all metadata.

Also see the Mirroring How-To, if you want to make a copy of large portions of the collection. The Roboting How-To has directions
for subsets of the collection.

### What are the most popular books, and how many times are they downloaded?
Go to the [Top 100 Page]().  

### Can I download and read your books?
Yes. That's what Project Gutenberg is all about — making texts available free to everyone!

### What am I allowed to do with the books I download?
Most Project Gutenberg e-texts are in the public domain. You can do anything you like with these — you can re-post them on your site, print them, distribute them, translate them to other languages, convert them to other formats, or redistribute them in unchanged form. However, if you distribute versions under the Project Gutenberg trademark, we do impose some conditions, which are explained in the header and/or footer in each text.

Some Project Gutenberg e-texts have copyright restrictions. You can still download and read these, but you may not be allowed to reproduce, modify or distribute them. When browsing or searching on the site, you will see these copyright-restricted texts indicated in the listings. For fuller information about them, download the e-text and read the header or footer of the file, which will spell out the conditions in detail.

See the Permissions How-To for details, especially for commercial (non-free) redistribution and derivatives. For people who want
to read, enjoy, and share these eBooks, the only limitation is that not all content is in the public domain around the world. The
"Terms of Use" (on the website and within every eBook) remind you to check the laws of your country, before accessing a PG eBook.

### Does Project Gutenberg know who downloads their books?
No, and we don't want to!

Like any Internet transfer, our sites have to know the IP addresses that contact them; without that, no communication is possible. But we do not trace, hold or examine them beyond what is necessary to deal with any problems or maintain logs or statistics. We never identify IP addresses with people. We never ask who you are, or ask you to register, to obtain eBooks.

Further, we encourage people, sites, schools around the world to mirror, or copy, our texts to their sites. Once that happens, we have no control over them, and we never have any idea who or even how many people access them after that.

Even further, we encourage people to distribute the texts by email, file sharing, disks, CDs, paper, and any other storage format they can find. We encourage them to convert the texts to other formats, and share them.

For most people reading this, anonymity is probably not an issue, but you may live in a place or time where reading Paine, or Voltaire, or the Bible, or the Koran, is considered suspicious or even subversive. We don't know who you are, and what we don't know, we can't tell.

### I've found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. How should I report them?
(This section was updated in October 2019)

Errata reports, typos, etc. are welcome and appreciated. Please visit the contact information page for the current correct email address to send reports to.

It is necessary to report the full title, author, and etext number of the text you are correcting. We have multiple editions of some texts, like Homer's "Odyssey", and unless you tell us exactly what eBook you mean we have to spend much time searching and guessing which file you were reading. It is important to specify that you are reporting errors found in the text, html, .mobi or .epub file.

It is usually easiest to cut and paste the line where the error is into your e-mail, with your comment.

A report for a typical errata list might look like: 
<pre>
The Odyssey, by Homer
         April, 1999  [Etext #1728]

      Line 884:
        back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month.
          "bas" should be "has"

      Line 1491:
        Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning
           "would" and "ask" are run together here

      Line 1563:
        in his father's seat and the elders gave place to him
           This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end.

      Line 15346-7:
         'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the
         will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have
            I think there is something missing between "the" and "will"
</pre>
But the following gets the job done: 
<pre>
      In Homer's Odyssey, Etext #1728,
      I found the following errors:

      Telemachus, who bas now resided
      change "bas" to "has"

      But I wouldask thee,
      "would ask" run together

      and the elders gave place to him
      needs period

      ye men of Ithaca, to the
      will say.
      line missing between "the" and "will"?
</pre>
Or, even shorter and easiest to use: 
<pre>
      In Homer's "Odyssey", Etext #1728, I found the
      following errors:

      Telemachus, who bas now resided
      bas ==> has

      But I wouldask thee,
      wouldask ==> would ask

      and the elders gave place to him
      him ==> him.

      ye men of Ithaca, to the
      will say.
      line or words missing between "the" and "will"?
</pre>
The common error of copying several lines or the entire paragraph which contains the error followed by the same paragraph with the error corrected makes it very difficult and time consuming for the editor to locate the error. Please use one of the errata report formats above.

On the other hand it is also important to give a long enough portion of the line with the error as there may be dozens of instances of a short phrase.

For example: 
<pre>
      to him
      him ==> him.
</pre>

may take 10 minutes or more of the editor's time searching for "to him" if there are 100 instances of "to him" in the eBook.

Experienced Project Gutenberg contributors may find that when there are a great many suspected errors it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected version of the text and html files.

If you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like "Gutcheck" or "Jeebies" to find errors, you might mention something like: "Gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes".

When you are able to find the eBook's title in an online eBook such as "The Internet Archive", it is a great help to us if you verify your suggested changes and in your report let us know you have done so and the source used.

Any errata submissions are freely made, without obligation, and are entirely in the public domain. 

### I've found some obvious typos in a Project Gutenberg text. Who should I report them to?
The Posting Team, who post the books, also make the corrections, and ultimately, the corrections need to go to them. Visit [the Contact Us](/about/contact_information.html) page for the current email address of the errata team (it is changed periodically to cut down on spam).

Many producers put their e-mail addresses in their texts, specifically so that readers can contact them when errors are found. If you see that in your text, you should try to contact the producer first. This is especially true if the corrections aren't obvious, as in the case of missing words. The producer is likely to have the original book, and will probably be able to confirm your corrections without visiting a library. If the book needs the corrections, the producer can then notify the Posting Team.

If you get no response from the producer, or if there is no e-mail address listed, or if the corrections are small and obvious, you should send them to the email address for reporting errors listed on the Contacts Page where members of the posting team will deal with them.

### I've reported some typos. What will happen next?
This varies wildly. Sometimes, you may just get a response e-mail in a day or three saying thanks, and that we've fixed the typo. This is normal when you've just reported one or a few obvious typos.

Where there is some text missing, or the changes you suggest are otherwise not obvious, we may have to find someone with an eligible copy of the book to confirm the changes, and that might take time. Normally, you will get an e-mail explaining that within a week.

Sometimes, even though you've noticed only one or two small typos, one of the Posting Team who was looking at it may find many more, and decide that the whole text needs to be re-proofed. This may also take time.

If the text needs a lot of changes, we may post a new EDITION [R.35] of it, with a new filename: e.g. abcde10.txt may become abcde11.txt. In this case, you will receive a copy of the e-mail sent to the posted list announcing the new file. Our current rule of thumb is that we create a new edition when we make twelve significant changes, but we judge each on a case-by-case basis, and especially will usually not make a new edition if the original was posted recently. 

## About the Files
### What types of files are there, and how do I read them?
The vast majority of our eBooks are available as plain text. You can read these with any editor or text viewer or browser. Some are HTML. You can read these with any browser.

For a fuller listing of other file types, and how to read them, please see the Formats FAQ [F.2]. 

### What do the filenames of the texts mean?
We name our files based on the PG eBook number; thus, the base of the name simply reflects the order in which the book was posted. 12345.txt is just the 12,345th book posted (more or less: there are some gaps in the number sequence). Friendlier filenames, or
variations on the eBook #, are sometimes included.

Formats or character sets other than plain ASCII then get extensions added to indicate the type of file. Character sets get digits; formats get letters. The most common of these are: 
- -0 for Unicode
- -8 for 8-bit plain text
- -h for HTML
- -m for MP3
- -r for RTF
- -t for TeX
- -x for XML

Thus, eBook number 12345 may — fairly typically — have the files 12345.txt, 12345.zip, 12345-8.txt, 12345-8.zip, 12345-h.htm and 12345-h.zip, as well as other possible character sets or formats.

Other formats get appropriate three-letter extensions, like -pdf.

## Please explain the folder (directory) structure:
1. Directory structure: the directory for the eBook shall be contained in a hierarchy of directories, each one a single digit, being all the digits of the etext number except the last, in order. The name of the directory for the eBook itself shall be the number of the eBook. Thus, eBook #12345 will be contained in: 

<pre>
/1/2/3/4/12345/
</pre>
and 123456 in 
<pre>
/1/2/3/4/5/123456/
</pre>
Where an e-book is a reposting of a pre-10,000 text, we will create an old/ subdirectory, containing all of the old files associated with that text. For example, consider:

    Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse 7423

The corrected, reposted files will be found in:

    /7/4/2/7423/

and the older, pre-10K files will all be held in:

    /7/4/2/7423/old/

2. Filenames within the eBook's directory shall be the eBook's number, with extensions preceded by a minus sign, indicating character set or format.

a) A file without a character set or format indicator is plain 7-bit ASCII. [In practice, we might allow a few 8-bit characters — up to a dozen or two — and still call it ASCII]

    Example: 12345.txt [7-bit plain vanilla ASCII]

b) Character sets, for text files, get digits:

   - -0 Unicode (including UTF-7, UTF-8, UCS-4, etc.)
   - -5 Big-5
   - -8 8-bit (including ISO 8859, Codepages, etc.)

   - Example: 12345-8.txt [Text in some 8-bit encoding]

c) File types get letters. Ideally, one-letter formats should be standards-based and editable. For now, the following is the list of single-letter formats.

   - -h HTML
   - -x XML
   - -r RTF
   - -t TEX
   - -m MP3

Other formats get preferably three (more if necessary) letters.

   - -lit LIT
   - -pdb PDB
   - -doc Word DOC
   - -mpg MPEG

   - Example: 12345-x.xml [XML]
   - Example: 12345-pdf.pdf [PDF]
When more than one variant of a format is posted, the poster will add additional letters as appropriate. 
   - Example: If a HTML of 12345 has been posted as 12345-h, and we are posting a new HTML if the same eBook broken into pages, it might be posted as 12345-hp.

3. Under the eBook's directory are all files for that eBook. The .txt files will be in the eBook's main directory, as well as other formats that require only one file (PDF, RTF, …). Formats that are likely to require ancillary files get a subdirectory named for file type, with the file within. This is to make it predictable to find the formats, and to allow for any ancillary files to be stored in the subdirectory. 
Formats that get a subdirectory include: HTML, TeX and XML. Formats that do not get a subdirectory include: PDF, RTF, LIT, PDB.

The subdir name for each shall be the name of the primary file that lives there. 
  - Example: The file 12345-h.htm will be at /12345/12345-h/12345-h.htm , and any ancillary files (such as JPEG or CSS) will be in (or below) the same subdirectory.

4. A .zip for each format will be in the main eBook directory. The .zip will unzip to a subdirectory if it's a multi-file format from #3 above, otherwise it will simply unzip a file. In the case of some pre-compressed formats, such as MP3, a .zip may not make sense, in which case it may be omitted. 
 - Example: 12345-h.zip will be at 12345/ , and when unzipped will create a subdirectory 12345-h/ with 12345-h.htm and any ancillary files.
 - Example: 12345-pdf.zip will be at 12345/, and when unzipped will create 12345-pdf.pdf in the current directory.

5. Versions and editions: in the case of a new EDITION, a corrected file, the original file is renamed with an extension of its own posted date .yyyymmdd, and then replaced by the corrected file. So 12345.txt, when replaced, becomes 12345.txt.20030101 and the new, corrected file becomes 12345.txt.  

New EDITIONS will get a "Most recently updated: " line added to their standard metadata.

The Release Date in the standard header will be the month and year of the actual first posting of that eBook. 

6. Each file (e.g., 12345-h.htm) should have a Project Gutenberg header, metadata and footer. In cases where the file is not editable (such as PDF), or where adding a header isn't realistic (such as MP3), the header, metadata and footer can go in a "readme" file named for the file, with "-readme" added before the extension. The "readme" file shall be in the same directory as the file to which it refers, and shall be included in the ZIP file for that format. Where the format is multifile, there should be only one "readme" for all files. 
 - Example: "12345-pdf-readme.txt" for the file 12345-pdf.pdf Note: If we were able to add the standard header prior to creating the PDF file, it could be distributed as any other editable format without a readme.
 - Example: "12345-m-readme.txt" for the files 12345-m-001.mp3, 12345-m-002.mp3, etc.

The following is an example of etext# 12345, assuming it has ASCII, 8-bit and Unicode text files, a HTML and a HTML broken into pages, an XML, PDF, TeX, and LIT formats, and MP3. Assume that we couldn't edit the LIT, and so had to add a "readme" for that containing the header as in point 6 above.

The directory 12345 for the eBook will be at

    1/2/3/4/12345/

and it will contain the files

    1/2/3/4/12345/12345.txt
    1/2/3/4/12345/12345.zip
    1/2/3/4/12345/12345-0.txt

### What are the "Etext/Ebook numbers" on the texts?
These are simply a series of numbers. We give one to each etext as it is posted, so the earliest etexts have low numbers and later etexts have higher numbers. Etext number 1 is the Declaration of Independence, the first text that Michael Hart typed in to the mainframe that he was using in 1971.

A few numbers are reserved for books that we hope to have in the PG archive someday; for example, 1984 is reserved for Orwell's classic.

When we improve an text by making some corrections, we call it a new EDITION, and it keeps the same etext number, but when we post a different VERSION of the same text, from a different paper book — like different translations of Homer's Odyssey — each new version gets a new etext number.

### What do the month and year on the text mean?
Project Gutenberg used to set a production target for itself. The idea was to produce X texts in a month, and in books before #10,000, we dated the texts according to what month of our schedule they appear in. For example, if our target for September 2000 was 50 texts, and we actually produced 55, then the last five would be dated October 2000, and we'd get a head-start on the month. At the time of writing the original FAQ, in July 2002, that target was the publication of 200 books per month. However, our actual production far outpaced our targets, with the result that the "head-start" had accumulated so much that in July 2002, we were releasing books scheduled for March, 2004!

The fact that we were so far ahead of schedule makes this quite confusing for newcomers. If it bothers you, just don't think about it! But at least it's better than being behind schedule. We didn't always produce so many books. In the September 1994 newsletter, Michael Hart wrote:

    As always, I am terrified of the prospect of doubling our output to 16 Etexts per month for next year, we really need your help!!!

That was when the Project's target was 8 Etexts per month. Today, our target is heading towards 12 eBooks per day!

In books after number 10,000, we abandoned the "Schedule Month, Year" idea, and the "Release Date" is the actual date on which we posted them.
