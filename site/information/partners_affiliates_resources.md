# Partners, Affiliates and Resources
From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free eBooks.

Project Gutenberg is happy to be a part of other organizations' efforts. On these pages, we list some of our affiliates. In addition, we are aware of some products or services which seek to promote the distribution of free or low-cost literature, or which otherwise distribute Project Gutenberg eBooks.


## Partners
- [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net). DP allows people to share in the tasks of proofreading, verifying and formatting eBooks for Project Gutenberg.
- [iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/index.html), the public's library. IBiblio is our main eBook distribution site, holds our Web pages, and offers a variety of supporting services.
- Project Gutenberg Consortia Center: [Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC)](http://www.gutenberg.cc). Collections of collections, with numerous languages and formats. Sponsored by the [World eBook Library](http://www.worldlibrary.net). Host of the [self.gutenberg.org](http://self.gutenberg.org) self-publishing portal.

## Sister Projects

### Project Gutenberg of Australia
[Project Gutenberg of Australia](http://gutenberg.net.au) provides books which are in the public domain in Australia.

As a general rule the works of authors who died before 1955 are in the public domain in Australia.  Works by George Orwell (died 1950), Virginia Woolf (died 1941), and James Joyce (died 1941), just to name a few authors, are in the public domain in Australia.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may remain copyrighted in other Countries, even for several decades. People may not download, or read online, such works if they are in a country where they are still under copyright. That still leaves a lot of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.

Project Gutenberg of Australia also provides a list all of the Project Gutenberg etexts (from both the US and Australian Collections) which were written by Australians or which relate (although loosely) to Australia, and has an extensive    collection of books by and about the land and sea explorers who opened up the continent to white settlement.

### Project Gutenberg of Canada
[Project Gutenberg of Canada](http://www.gutenberg.ca) specializes in Canadiana literature in English and French, in the public domain in Canada. [help proofread](http://www.pgdpcanada.net/) through Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.

### Projekt Gutenberg DE
[Projekt Gutenberg-DE](http://gutenberg.spiegel.de). German literature. This was the second site to ask Michael Hart to use the Project Gutenberg name and concept, for German-language content. Currently run by a for-profit organization (Hille + Partner GbR), PG-DE provides free eBooks via their Web site, as well as selling eBooks on CD or DVD. For more information about PG-DE, read this German [Wikipedia article](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projekt_Gutenberg-DE). PG-DE runs their own Distributed Proofreaders site for content they distribute, but claims copyright on their work. The content from the central [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net) does not have such restrictions, and is intended for unlimited redistribution.

### Project Gutenberg Europe

Self-published works are welcome, as are works published previously.

### Projekt Runeberg
[Project Runeberg](http://runeberg.org). Nordic literature. Historically, this was the first site to ask Michael Hart to use a name similar to Project Gutenberg for a sister project.
