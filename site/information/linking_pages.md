You are welcome to link to this site, but please follow the rules.

## Rules
- You may link to our site.  You need no permission to do so.
- If you link to one of our books, [do not try to link directly to a file](#do-not-link-directly-to-the-ebook-files) but use a [canonical URL](#canonical-urls-to-books-and-authors).
- We will not sign silly legal forms. You need no permission, so we won't sign grants.
- We do not participate in link exchanges. These often are attempts to boost search engine ranking with our popularity. We will however consider linking to your site if it contains valuable resources for our users, like book listings or author biographies.
-  Unlike our books the Project Gutenberg site is copyrighted. It is **expressly forbidden** to make our contents look like it came from your site irrespective of the method used (frames,[image inlining](#image-inlining), roboting, rewriting, etc.). Just use plain links.

## Do Not Link Directly to the eBook Files

Direct links to files will be redirected to the appropriate catalog page. Direct links to files are bad because:

- we may move the file, breaking your link,
- we may post an updated edition with a different filename and your link will point to the old edition,
- a file represents just one available format, the user following your link will not know that there are other formats to choose from,
- the user will not realize the wealth of related material to be found in our archive.

But if you run an independent search site for our books read the [independent search site section](#independent-project-gutenberg-serach-sites) below.

## Canonical URLs to Books and Authors
If you want to link to one of our books or authors please use only the URL formats described here.

- **http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12345** 

This URL will always lead to the catalog page of the ebook with the number 12345 (replace 12345 with the ebook number you are interested in).
- **http://www.gutenberg.org/author/Mark_Twain**

This URL will always lead to a list of all books by the author "Mark Twain". (Replace Mark_Twain with the author you are interested in. Use an underscore or a plus sign in place of spaces.)
- Use **http://www.gutenberg.org/author/Henry_James_(1843-1916)** 
if you have to disambiguate between authors. If only one date is known or certain use (1843-) or (-1916). The parens and the hyphen are required.

## Image Inlining

You may use all images from our  ebooks not protected by U.S. copyright law on your site.  If the book is not protected by U.S. copyright law, the images in the book are also not protected by U.S. copyright law.  Read the license inside the book to find out if the book is protected by U.S. copyright law.  However **you must copy the image** and host it on your site, not link to the image hosted on our site. (Use your favorite search engine to identify free image hosting services, if needed.)
Our servers are configured not to serve images to third-party websites. Therefore your users may only see a warning notice instead of the intended picture.

## Independent Project Gutenberg Search Sites

Some sites provide their own search engine for Project Gutenberg eBooks. Some of them are dedicated to Project Gutenberg only, other include books from a variety of free collections in their database.

If you are running a site that provides search functions for Project Gutenberg eBooks, contact us and we'll setup our servers to allow deep linking
from your site. We request, however, that you prominently display a live link to the Project Gutenberg home page [https://www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org) next to
the deep link to the eBook file. If you are dedicated to Project Gutenberg eBooks only, the link has to be displayed just once on every search results page.

Note that the Project Gutenberg Catalog is now [available in machine-readable format](/wiki/Gutenberg:Feeds). Please use one of those files to feed your database instead of [roboting our site](/information/robot_access.html).
