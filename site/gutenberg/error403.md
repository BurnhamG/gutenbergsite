Error 403
=========

Sorry, but our website automatically denied you access to that page.

Maybe you have just a wrong url. Go to [www.gutenberg.org](/) to see whether the error persists.

If you get the error again, this might explain what is happening:
- Visiting from a German Internet address?  As of February 27 2018, addresses in Germany are blocked.  For more information, see <a href="https://block.pglaf.org/germany.shtml">block.pglaf.org/germany.shtml</a>.</li>
- Anonymized IP addresses might trigger automated anti-abuse blocks.  This can happen with anonymizers, open proxies, VPNs, or TOR, and includes the Google proxies that are used by Chrome.</li>
- Don't access Project Gutenberg from hosted servers.</li>
- Don't use automated software to download lots of books. We have a limit on how fast you can go while using this site. If you surpass this limit you get blocked automatically, and eventually blocks expire automatically.</li>
- Kindle users, and people using shared IP addresses (such as some schools) might trigger a block due to too many requests coming from the same address.  </li>
- If you use the RSS feed, set your update interval to 24 hours.</li>

## What to do if I'm blocked inappropriately
If you are sure that none of the above applies to you, 
and wish us to investigate the problem, please visit
<a href="http://block.pglaf.org">block.pglaf.org</a> and send the diagnostic
information to the email address listed there.

If you were blocked mistakenly or inappropriately from accessing Project Gutenberg, we apologize for this.  There are a variety of mechanisms we use to try to keep the site responsive, and they do not always work as intended.  The instructions above will help to adjust the system, to enhance the ability of people to read Project Guteberg eBooks.
